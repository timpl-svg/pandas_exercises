1. If you had a spreadsheet with data, which pandas data structure would you use to hold the
data? Why?

It depends on how the data is organised. If a spreadsheet is just a single column
then i'd use a Series object.
Otherwise DataFrame is the right option.

2. If you had a database with data, which pandas data structure would you use to hold the data?
Why?

Since the database is a table in most cases I'd use DataFrame object.
